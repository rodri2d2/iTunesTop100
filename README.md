# iTunesTop100
This iOS app displays the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API

![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.3-F16D39.svg?style=flat)

A simple app that loads a song list based on iTunes RSS Generator. This is a pretty simple but functional app.


## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal for this version is to create an app to access a remote server that simply show the list on the screen.

```
Actually, the main goal is:
- To apply MVVM architecture correctly.
- Create a Network layer that is easy to implement and expand it if is needed.
- Create a useful and beautiful user interface based only on code files no NIB or storyboard at all
```
