# iTunesTop100
This iOS app displays the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API

![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.3-F16D39.svg?style=flat)

A simple app that loads a song listwhere you can create notebook and notes inside it. This a pretty simple but functional app.


## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal for this version is to create an app to access a remote server that simply show the list on the screen.

```
Actually, the main goal is to apply MVVM architecture correctly, create a Network layer that is easy to implement and expand it if is needed, also, create a useful and beautiful user interface based only on code files no NIB or story board at all
```

> NOTE: App not finished yet

- [X] URLSession
- [X] DispatchQueue
- [X] MVVM
- [X] NO Storyboard
